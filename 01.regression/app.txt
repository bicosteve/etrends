Linear Regression 
-> seeks to find the linear relationship between a dependant variable (y the variable you want to predict) and the independent variable (the variables you are using to make predictions).
-> It essentially tries to get the 'best-fit' straight that best represent the data
-> The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual observed values often done using least squares method
